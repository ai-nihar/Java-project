# Game Arcade

## 🎮 About the Project

Game Arcade is a Java-based collection of three interactive command-line games:

- **Tic-Tac-Toe** – Play against another player or the computer.
- **Minesweeper** – Classic board game with difficulty levels.
- **2048** – Merge tiles to reach 2048.

This project was developed as part of my Semester 1 learning experience to enhance Java programming skills, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), recursion, and user interaction.

## 🚀 Features

- **Three Classic Games** – Play Tic-Tac-Toe, Minesweeper, and 2048.
- **Registration & Login System** – Secure user authentication with OTP verification.
- **Data Validation** – Ensures correct user input and prevents errors.
- **Command-Line Interface** – Simple and interactive user experience.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Concepts Applied:**
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Recursion for input validation and game logic
  - Math.random() for game mechanics
  - Scanner for command-line input handling

## 📌 Future Improvements

While the project is completed as of now, I may consider making improvements in the future, such as:

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** – Replace command-line interface with a visual UI.
- **Multiplayer Mode** – Play online with friends.
- **Save and Load Games** – Resume progress anytime.
